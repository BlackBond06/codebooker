# Developer Environment Setup

This section will contain information that will help you:

- [Clone the project](#clone),
- Set up the project in their IDE or editor,
- Set up their environment to work in the project, including any environment variables, yarn/npm/pnpm package(s), editor extensions or plugins needed,
- Setting up the connection to the database,
- Setting up the local development database, MongoDB.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
This CRA allows developers to view the application in a web browser, make changes to the code, and see those changes reflected immediately without having to manually refresh the page. This feature is known as "hot/live reloading".

> Get your project started in your ide, any IDE is preferable. I woudl be using vs code as a template to run threough this setup.
Some may like to make ther edits through the github workspace, but its more conducive, faster, seamless and easier to make changes to this repository using the terminal through git commands.
Now to get this to your local repository you would need to performthese few steps

## Clone this repository <a name="clone"></a>
this simply is a means to making an exact photocopy of this repostiroty in your computer.
this step is to be taken after you have firked the repository and you have the exact copy of the repository on your github profile.

navigate to the left side of your screen where this is a green drop dpwn menu with code is located and click on this, this will immediately bring out a small dialog box, make no changes to tis box and simply copy the url provided for you on this box.

## Setup In your IDE

next, move down to your system and create a new folder in your desktop/ document folder or any placd of your choice and name this codebooker. open your IDE and navigate to open folders and select the folder you just created and click open.

this imediately opens up a worksace for you. NOw in this IDE navigate to your terminal and type in the `git init` command. this initializes the repository and gets it set for the next course of action.

with your already copied url from github type in `git remote add origin <paste your copied url like this>` and paste . this command immediatley kickstarts the cloning process and replicates all the files from the main reposiry into your local repository. And you have finally setupo your working environment.



## Setup the project

Now to fully integrate the repository in your local application you would need to integrate some environment variables and dependencies to be able to setup this project properly to work with









## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Developers often derive more convenience in seeking permission from the project to contribute, so these next headings will get you started in no time contributing.

## Pick an issue to handle

If you are not sure what to work on, review the issues list first. There are also TODO's listed in the included [TODO.md](./TODO.md) file. 
@gbowne1 and other project maintainers will assign users to issues on a first come, first serve basis. If you would like to work on an issue, feel free to indicate by tagging the mentioned persons.

## Create an issue

If you notice a typo, slight bug in the code and there are no lodged complaints on this yet, click on the issues icon at the top, and on the right side of the next page select new issues and lodge your complain.

## Fork this repository

After choosing what to work on, move to setup your workspace.

On the project's repository page, look to the right side of the page to locate a fork tab, click on this icon, and this would redirect you to a new page with further instructions. 

On this next page, If you are satisfied with the suggested project name click on create fork, and this automatcically creates your workspace.

## Editor & IDE

The repository contains folders with project appropriate settings and configurations for Visual Studio code, but beyond that, we are tool and editor/IDE agnostic so you can use whatever editor or IDE or you like.

Follow the instructions in the [DEVSETUP](/docs/DEVSETUP.md) to setup your IDE workspace.

## Prerequisites to use Database for programmers

Adequate knowledge in the Reach programming language.

React gives us built-in hooks such as useEffect, useSelector, useRef, useHook, useCallback, useContext, useMemo, useForm, useHistory, etc. Please make sure to make the most use of these provided React built-ins.

The browser also gives us things like localStorage, IndexedDB, Session Storage, Cookies and Cache Storage. Please make use of them for

Please also make sure you use accessibility (A11y) with themes and styles paying attention to focus styling, contrast and keyboard-accesibility.

You should already be familiar with React 17 and or 18, JavaScript ES5/ES6/ES7.

Assignees, Reviewers, Labels, Projects, Milestone(s) and Development before you submit the PR.
Also share a screenshot or show the working fix in the Pull Request message and a brief description of what you fixed.
Keep in mind that Blank issues and especially PR's without a description of the changes you made may not get merged.

-   Link an issue to Development that the PR will close
-   Make sure that you tag a reviewer i.e. @gbowne1
-   Pick appropriate labels from Labels
-   Make sure you are the assignee to the PR.
-   Milestone, choose Frontend or Backend (more may come later on)

Babel
Webpack
ESLint
Prettier
VSCode (.vscode)
GitHub (.github)

These may not be 100% correct, so if you can contribute to them to make them more accurate for React development it is welcomed.

We understand it is not a good idea to contribute the configuration to the project, however this will greatly improve the new user experience getting

## Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
This application is built with:

-   React 18.2
-   JavaScript (ES5/ES6/ES7/ES2015/etc.)
-   NodeJS
-   ExpressJS
-   Material UI v5.11.6
-   Jest and React's testing-library for all testing
-   Prisma and/or MongoDB/Mongoose

All core components are built with JSX.

## Branches

Our branches follow GitFlow / GitHub Flow as a general rule.

-   [ main ] main working branch
-   [ master ] Permanent // Archive branch
-   [ test ] untested code
-   Feature Branch # of feature - {feature}
-   [bugfix - { fixed bug }]
-   [hotfix - { fix }]

Use a test branch to commit/push code that you believe should work but is not completely tested.

## How to contribute

 <!-- yes anyone can contribute to this. You spot an error in the documentation? you can scan through for any opene issues and if there isnt create an issue to notify the project of thia sbug or typi. -->

Developers often derive more convenience in seeking permission from the project to contribute to help build and develop this project, however the project also encourgaes a fast forward means of forking thisproject and working on a possible development amd creating a pull request whuc would be emrged if the development feels feasible and in-line with the projects visioon.

likewise, devs can also scan through issues and notify the project to contribute and would be assigned to an issue to help rectify.

<!-- A lot of developers prefer asking if they could contribute or be assigned a task as a reply to a reported issue in the Issues tab. This is great. -->

however, if assigned to an issue an dyou later change your mind or cant figure it out please notify the team so that the issue can be reassigned to another for fast development and rectification.

## Development

If you are not sure what to work on, review the issues list. There are also TODO's that listed in the included [TODO.md](./TODO.md) file.

React gives us built-in hooks such as useEffect, useSelector, useRef, useHook, useCallback, useContext, useMemo, useForm, useHistory, etc. Please make sure to make the most use of these provided React built-ins.

The browser also gives us things like localStorage, IndexedDB, Session Storage, Cookies and Cache Storage. Please make use of them for

Please also make sure you use accessibility (A11y) with themes and styles paying attention to focus styling, contrast and keyboard-accesibility.

Also share a screenshot or show the working fix in the Pull Request message and a brief description of what you fixed.
Keep in mind that Blank issues and especially PR's without a description of the changes you made may not get merged.

-   Link an issue to Development that the PR will close
-   Make sure that you tag a reviewer i.e. @gbowne1

## Editor & IDE

The repository contains folders with project appropriate settings and configurations for Visual Studio and Visual Studio code but beyond that, We are tool and editor/IDE agnostic so you can use whatever editor or IDE or you like.

## Settings & Configuration

The included workspaces, settings, configurations and plugins are for:

Babel
Webpack
ESLint
Prettier
VSCode (.vscode)
GitHub (.github)

These may not be 100% correct, so if you can contribute to them to make them more accurate for React development it is welcomed.

We understand it is not a good idea to contribute the configuration to the project, however this will greatly improve the new user experience getting
started working with our code base.

## Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
This application is built with:

-   React 18.2
-   JavaScript (ES5/ES6/ES7/ES2015/etc.)
-   NodeJS

All core components are built with JSX.

## Branches

Our branches follow GitFlow / GitHub Flow as a general rule.

-   [ main ] main working branch
-   [ master ] Permanent // Archive branch
-   [ test ] untested code
-   Feature Branch # of feature - {feature}
-   [bugfix - { fixed bug }]
-   [hotfix - { fix }]

Use a test branch to commit/push code that you believe should work but is not completely tested.
